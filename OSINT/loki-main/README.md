# What's Loki?
**Loki can create a sock puppet identity, that you can use to create a fake online presence to start your investigations. As an OSINT, Private or any other Investigator who seeks to conduct OSINT investigations; you need a sock puppet which cannot be traced back to you. Setting up a sock puppet is easy; only if you know where to look for.**

**Loki automates this process and provides you with all the necessary details for the creation of your sock puppet. Loki is in the initial stages of development and more features will be added over time. Loki has the capability of providing you with not only the details but also an AI Generated image from this [website](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) as of 26/10/22. Many more features will be added as the project continues.**
